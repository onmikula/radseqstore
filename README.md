# radseqstore
A storage room for scripts and functions used for analyses of (dd)RAD sequences.

The bash scripts were written for computations at machines of MetaCentrum, the Czech academic computational grid (https://metavo.metacentrum.cz). They can contain some features, that are specific to this computational grid and, thus, they may need to be modified before being used elsewhere. The same applies to paths included in the scripts as they don't match the directory structure of this repository. All the scripts are shortly commented below.
